# CMPSC 458 Project 1
by Elizabeth Pao

## About 
This is a project for CMPSC 458: Computer Graphics to implement transformations of a cube, add camera and camera movement, a skybox, and a heightmap. I had not known about the starter code files until I finished the skybox (and ended up taking much longer because of that mistake) so I tried to merge my code with the project1.cpp code afterwards and by following a tutorial from Learn OpenGL (credited down below). I also tried for extra credit, which is in more detail below. 

## Installation and Setup 
On your local machine, download and unzip the Project1.zip file provided, and then run the Project1.exe file. 
## Commands (Movement of cubes and camera) 

## Extra Credit
